# SafinaDB

SafinaDB (safina;ÿ≥ŸÅŸäŸÜÿ©;ship;saa-fee-na) is a custom-built database engine designed to be efficient, stable and fast **(for learning purposes)**. Inspired by the Arabic word for "ship".
This project is developed incrementally, starting from a basic key-value store to an advanced distributed database system.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

### [Version 1: Basic Key-Value Store](https://github.com/aallali/SafinaDB/blob/v1/roadmaps/version1.md) ‚è≥
- Data Storage: File-based storage for key-value pairs.
- Basic CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality.
- Simple CLI: Command-line interface for interacting with the database.

### Version 2: In-Memory Cache
- In-Memory Data Structure: Add an in-memory hash map for faster access.
- Write-Through Cache: Implement caching with write-through to disk.
- Basic Indexing: Simple in-memory indexing for fast lookups.

### Version 3: Persistence and Recovery
- Log-based Storage: Implement write-ahead logging for durability.
- Recovery Mechanism: Add crash recovery to replay logs.
- Data Serialization: Efficient serialization and deserialization of data.

### Version 4: Advanced Indexing
- B-Tree Indexes: Implement B-tree indexing for efficient range queries.
- Secondary Indexes: Add support for secondary indexes.
- Query Optimization: Basic query optimization techniques.

### Version 5: Concurrency Control
- Locking Mechanism: Implement basic locking for concurrent access.
- Transactions: Support for transactions with ACID properties.
- Isolation Levels: Implement different transaction isolation levels.

### Version 6: Replication
- Master-Slave Replication: Basic replication for high availability.
- Data Synchronization: Mechanism to sync data between nodes.
- Fault Tolerance: Basic fault tolerance and failover.

### Version 7: Advanced Features
- Query Language: Implement a simple query language (e.g., SQL-like syntax).
- Stored Procedures: Support for stored procedures and functions.
- User Authentication: Basic user authentication and access control.

## [future goals] Will keep them here for motivation.
### *Version 8: Performance Optimization*
- Caching Strategies: Implement advanced caching strategies.
- Compression: Data compression for efficient storage.
- Performance Tuning: Optimize data structures and algorithms for performance.

### *Version 9: Distributed Database*
- Sharding: Implement data sharding across multiple nodes.
- Consistency Protocols: Implement consistency protocols like Quorum or Paxos.
- Distributed Transactions: Support for distributed transactions and two-phase commit.

### *Version 10: Final Refinements*
- Comprehensive Testing: Extensive testing for stability and performance.
- Documentation: Detailed documentation and user guides.
- Release: Finalize the release and publish as an open-source project.
